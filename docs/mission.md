# projectlighthouse - Mission & Purpose

## Core Mission
Bridge the gap between framework users and systems builders. Help programmers transition from "using tools" to "building tools."

## Problem Being Solved
- Engineers who want to build systems software (TCP servers, kernels, low-level tools) don't know where to start
- Framework-first education creates users, not builders
- Lack of practical, project-driven systems programming education

## Target Audience
- Junior/mid-level engineers wanting to understand fundamentals
- Self-taught developers wanting systems knowledge
- Anyone who feels "stuck" using only high-level frameworks

## Philosophy
- Learning by building, not just consuming
- Project-driven approach
- "Be the person you needed when you were younger"
- Focus on production-ready skills, not just theory

## Current State
- Text-based course platform (books → pages structure)
- Commenting system
- Note-taking on selected text
- Behind middleware (admin only currently)
- Live at: https://projectlighthouse.io

## Technology Stack
- Primary languages: Go, Rust (no JavaScript/Next.js)
- Systems programming focus
- Topics: networking, concurrency, memory management, containers, kernels
