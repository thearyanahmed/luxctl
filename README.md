## Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. Update version in both `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs`
2. Run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock`
3. Commit and push to master
4. Wait for Auto Tag workflow to create the version tag
5. Trigger the Release workflow:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run Release --field tag=v0.6.2
   ```

The Release workflow will:
- Run tests
- Verify version matches tag
- Publish to crates.io
- Generate changelog
- Create GitHub release
